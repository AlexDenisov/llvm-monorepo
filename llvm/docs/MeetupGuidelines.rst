How to start LLVM Social in your town
=====================================

Below you can find suggestions on how to run a LLVM Social in your city.


General suggestions
-------------------

* It is recommended to get a Code of Conduct. You can simply use LLVM's
  `CoC <https://llvm.org/docs/CodeOfConduct.html>`_ or pick one that is
  tailored towards offline events
  (`example <https://berlincodeofconduct.org>`_).
* Although not mandatory, your group could be using the https://meetup.com
  infrastructure, which allows to have one central location for all LLVM meetup
  groups we have (see https://www.meetup.com/pro/llvm). The LLVM Foundation can
  take in charge the cost of your local LLVM meetup group on meetup.com. Reach
  arnaud.degrandmaison@llvm.org for more details.
* Beware of cultural differences: what works well in US may not work in Europe
  or Asia.
* Do not be alone to organize meetup. Try to work with a couple other
  organizers. This is more motivating as an organizer, and this makes the
  meetup more resilient over time.
* Try to record the talks if possible. Any modern smartphone or tablet should
  work, but you can also get a camera. It adds visibility to the meetup and
  just a good idea in general :) See an `example:
  <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmo9Xl8PKe5vZH7u75vbTc60dRSFs-8NE>`_.

Advertisement
-------------

* Try to advertise via similar meetups/user groups
* Advertise your meetup on the mailing lists (cfe-dev, llvm-dev, lldb-dev, ...).
  But as this mailing lists have a high traffic, using the mailing feature from
  meetup.com where people interested in the LLVM meetups can subscribe to the
  announcement, can help to reach more LLVM developers or users, especially
  those not so active on the mailing lists.
* Advertise the meetup on Twitter and mention
  `@llvmweekly <http://twitter.com/llvmweekly>`_ and
  `@llvmorg <http://twitter.com/llvmorg>`_.
* Announce the next meetup in advance, and remind in one week or so.

Meetup content
--------------

* It’s a great idea to have several talks scheduled for several upcoming
  meetups to get the ball rolling.
* `LLVM Weekly <http://llvmweekly.org/>`_ is a great topic starter: go through
  the 3-4 recent LLVM Weekly posts and prepare a list of the most
  interesting/notable news and discuss them with the group.
* Keep looking for speakers far in advance, ideally you should have.

Where to host the meetup?
-------------------------

* Look around for bars/cafe with projectors.
* Talk to tech companies in the area.
* Some co-working spaces provide their facilities for non-profit (i.e., you do
  not charge attendees any fees) meetups.
* Ask across universities around.

How to pick the date?
---------------------

* Make sure you do not clash with the similar meetups in the city (e.g.,
  C++ user groups).
* Prefer not to have a meetup the same week when the other similar meetups
  happen (e.g., it’s not a good idea to have LLVM meetup on Thursday after
  C++ meetup on Wednesday).
* Meetups on weekends may attract people who live far away from the city,
  but the people who live in the city may not attend.
* Make a poll, but beware than not every responder will actually join (we had
  ~20 votes on the poll, while only ~8 people attended).
